## Manufacturing
### Corners
SLA 3D printed at JLC3DP using JLC Black Resin.
### Rods
5/3mm carbon fiber rods cut to length.

## Errata
* Hole clearance was made large to facilitate assembly. That was not necessary and makes it hard to assemble the support ouside the bag. Mitigation: painters tape.
